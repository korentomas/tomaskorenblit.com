I saw a cool tweet by [@natochi_](https://twitter.com/natochi_) and joined a hackathon for the first time in a few years. I had missed the adrenaline and excitement of meeting awesome people and building and learning all in such a little span of time.

When deciding on an idea I said to myself: I want to build something fun, and something that everyone around me will like. I had been thinking about how GenAI could start to be used for gaming so I decided to look into it. After doing some research I ended up deciding on creating a web game with Three.JS where people could create their own weapons and the assets for the game itself as they played.

That's how DungeonSlopper was born. A dungeon where the anti-creme de la creme slop hides away from the world, and you brave hero are the one responsible for slaying the slop. Check it out at [dungeonslopper.vercel.app](https://dungeonslopper.vercel.app). I only put 10 USD for credits for StabilityAI for the diffusion model, so maybe by the time you read this the game doesn't have any credits left for asset creation. If so send a message here and I'll make sure to top it up so that you can play.

I ended up winning. The game worked flawlessly during the two minute demo. But I won because I sold it the right way.

## What worked

- I was one of the last to go. I HAD to get people's attention.
- Sound design mattered. I used Claude to write all sounds and music using MIDI. That helped create an image of the build as more polished, higher quality.
- I was funny. I fraternised with my fellow builders during the entire night. Before the vote I kept showing everyone the game, easter eggs, and features that didn't fit demo time.
- When results came in I had crushed it.

I want to keep meeting incredible people who inspire me to build great things.
