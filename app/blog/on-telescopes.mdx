The first telescope I built cost twelve dollars in filament and took six hours to print. It wasn't good. The focuser wobbled, the mirror mount was too tight, and the whole thing looked like it was designed by someone who had never seen a telescope.

It was. I hadn't.

But here's the thing about telescopes: even a bad one shows you Saturn's rings. Even a twelve-dollar one makes a kid gasp. And that gasp — that moment where the universe stops being abstract and becomes *real* — that's worth every failed print.

UNICOPE started as a homework project. It became something I think about every week. The goal is simple: make telescopes so cheap and so easy to build that anyone with a 3D printer can point one at the sky.

We're not there yet. But we're closer than twelve dollars ago.
