Starting over is clarifying. Not because the old thing was bad, but because you know what you actually want now.

This site is that. A place to write, think out loud, share what I'm working on. No analytics dashboards, no engagement metrics. Just words on a screen that feels like mine.

I keep coming back to something Kenya Hara wrote — that a vessel is useful not because of its walls, but because of the space inside. That's what I want here. A container, not a display case.

More soon.
