There is something clarifying about starting over. Not because the old thing was bad, but because you have learned enough to know what you actually want.

This site is that. A place to write, to think out loud, to share what I'm working on. No analytics dashboards, no engagement metrics. Just words on a screen that feels like mine.

I've been thinking about what Kenya Hara calls *emptiness as potential* — the idea that a vessel is useful not because of its walls, but because of the space inside. That's what I want this to be. A container, not a display case.

More soon.
