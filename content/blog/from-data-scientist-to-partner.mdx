Six months ago, I was a data scientist optimizing ML pipelines. Today, I'm a partner at Ascendancy, co-building relationship intelligence infrastructure from scratch. Here's what I've learned about making that jump.

## Depth > Breadth (At First)

Early in your career, there's pressure to be a "full-stack data scientist"—know Python, SQL, cloud infra, frontend, product, and somehow machine learning too. It's overwhelming and leads to being mediocre at everything.

Instead, go deep on one thing. For me, it was graph algorithms and Bayesian statistics. That depth became my unfair advantage. When we started building at Ascendancy, I could immediately contribute real value on the hard technical problems.

**Lesson**: Master one domain first. You can expand breadth later from a position of strength.

## Build Things That Compound

Not all projects are created equal. Some deliver value once and disappear. Others compound—each iteration makes the next one easier and more valuable.

Examples that compound:
- Infrastructure and tools others use
- Content that stays evergreen
- Relationships with smart people
- Technical skills with long half-lives

Examples that don't:
- One-off consulting projects
- Vanity side projects you'll never maintain
- Chasing hot technologies before understanding fundamentals

At Ascendancy, everything we build is designed to compound. Each client's network data makes our algorithms better. Each feature we ship makes the platform stickier. Each piece of content we create attracts better opportunities.

## Partnership Means Ownership (Real Ownership)

Being an employee is comfortable. You have a clear role, defined responsibilities, and someone else worries about the business side.

Partnership is different. You're responsible for *everything*:
- Technical execution
- Product decisions
- Sales and client relationships
- Fundraising strategy
- Operational details

It's exhausting. It's also incredibly rewarding.

**Key shift**: You stop asking "what should I work on?" and start asking "what needs to exist?" Then you build it.

## Technical Skills Are Necessary But Not Sufficient

Being great at ML or software engineering gets you in the door. But building a company requires:

1. **Communication**: Explaining complex technical concepts simply
2. **Strategic thinking**: Knowing which problems to solve
3. **Execution speed**: Shipping fast with high quality
4. **People skills**: Building relationships, hiring, managing

The good news: you can learn these. The bad news: you have to.

I'm still learning. Every client call improves my communication. Every technical decision sharpens my product intuition. Every mistake teaches me something about execution.

## Do Things That Don't Scale

Paul Graham's famous advice applies triple when you're starting from zero.

We could have spent 6 months building a perfect self-service platform. Instead, we:
- Manually onboard each client
- Run custom analyses by hand
- Do white-glove intro services
- Iterate rapidly based on feedback

This "unscalable" approach let us learn 100x faster than building in isolation. We discovered what people actually need vs. what we thought they need.

**Later**, we'll automate. But first, we had to learn what to automate.

## The Best Time to Start Was Yesterday

I waited too long to make this jump. I kept thinking "I need more experience" or "I should learn X first."

Looking back, I was ready earlier than I thought. The missing ingredient wasn't technical skills—it was conviction and the right co-founders.

If you're thinking about starting something, the biggest risk isn't failing—it's waiting so long that someone else builds it first.

I don't know if Ascendancy will be a home run. But I do know I'm learning faster, building more impactful things, and having more fun than I ever did as an employee.

If you're on the fence about making a similar jump, DM me. Happy to share what I've learned (including the hard parts I glossed over here).
