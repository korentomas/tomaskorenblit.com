I've been putting this off for too long. Writing publicly always felt self-indulgent—who am I to share my thoughts when there are smarter people with bigger platforms?

But I've realized that's exactly the wrong framing.

## Why Write?

Writing clarifies thinking. Every time I sit down to write about a technical problem, I discover gaps in my understanding. The act of explaining forces precision.

Writing builds relationships. The best conversations I've had started because someone read something I wrote and reached out. Ideas are connection points.

Writing compounds. A blog post written today might help someone years from now. It's one of the few things that gets more valuable over time without additional effort.

## What to Expect

I'm going to write about:

- **Graph systems and network capital**: How relationship data becomes strategic advantage
- **Building with AI**: Real-world applications beyond chatbots
- **Data science in practice**: Bayesian methods, causal inference, and when to use what
- **Startup lessons**: What I'm learning building Ascendancy from zero
- **Technical deep dives**: Algorithms, architectures, and implementation details

The goal isn't to be comprehensive or authoritative. It's to share what I'm learning, clarify my thinking, and hopefully help someone else along the way.

## The Format

Most posts will be short (500-1000 words). Some will be deep technical dives. A few might just be half-baked ideas I'm working through.

I'm optimizing for consistency over polish. Better to ship imperfect thoughts than to let them rot in drafts forever.

## Let's Connect

If something resonates (or if you think I'm completely wrong), reach out. I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomaskorenblit), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tomaskorenblit), and email (tomaskorenblit@gmail.com).

The best part of writing publicly isn't broadcasting—it's the conversations that follow.

Let's build.
